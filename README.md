# Pi_Scripts
Various scripts I made because I got tired of doing them over again when I broke something. 

Some scripts are very simple, others have been modified thru the use of either 'Claude', 'ChatGPT-4' or Llama 3.2:8B. I do not take credit for the modifications made as it was not my work, all credit should go to the dev's who are able to make this possible for us. I do take credit for the original idea of the script before modification and ask that before you implement anything, review the code before implementing it in your own enviornment. I am not liable for any issues that may occur should that happen. If you feel that an improvement can be made, please help yourself and fork till your hearts content.
